# Complete ReactJS Course

## Introduction

React, often referred to as ReactJS or React.js, is a JavaScript library used to build user interfaces (UIs) for web and mobile applications. It's known for its efficient and flexible component-based architecture, allowing developers to create reusable UI elements. React uses JSX, a syntax extension that allows developers to write HTML-like code within their JavaScript, simplifying the UI development process. 

### JavaScript Library:
React is a library, not a full-fledged framework, meaning it provides tools and functionalities that developers can use within their projects. 
### Component-Based:
React applications are built from components, which are reusable pieces of UI with their own logic and appearance. 
### JSX:
JSX is a syntax extension that allows developers to write HTML-like code within JavaScript, making it easier to define the UI structure. 
### Virtual DOM:
React uses a virtual DOM (Document Object Model) to efficiently update the UI when changes occur, enhancing performance. 
### Server-Side Rendering:
React can be used for server-side rendering, which improves page load times and SEO. 
### React Native:
React Native allows developers to build mobile apps with React, sharing code and components between web and native platforms. 
### Maintainance by Meta:
React is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a community of developers.
